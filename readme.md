# Meta Composer

A tool for traversing arbitrary information

## What is Meta Composer?

This tool is based on the premises:

- LLMs are good at using ["layered tools"](https://engineering.block.xyz/blog/build-mcp-tools-like-ogres-with-layers)
- Claude Code will excel at using any simple, expressive, CLI

This tool leverages those two ideas to give Claude Code (and similar agenst) a way to traverse documentation and metadata to build up context that is useful.
