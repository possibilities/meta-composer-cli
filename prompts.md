# Prompt history

A manually curated prompt history for every commit in the project

- Each new decimal step started with a new chat
- Plan mode was always accepted or discarded, unless otherwise noted
- No Claude.md or other external context other than prompting to read specific files

## 1 [plan mode]

```
We're making a CLI with typescript and commander JS. It is called `meta-composer`

This is the code for a similar utility. Use it as the template and reference for how to structure a similar tool in this project. Read the source code from this project to make any decision about how a CLI should be written. Read: ~/code/docs/repomix.claude-composer.xml

`meta-compser` CLI has 4 subcommands:

- `build` <resource> <type>`
- `list <resource> <type>`
- `peek <resource> <id>, [<id>]`
- `show <resource> <id>, [<id>]`

Let's write all the boilerplate needed for this CLI tool so we can then start working on the business logic

Make a blank readme with only the title of the project as a header

Handlers for the commands, configuration for the subcommands and flags

Don't write any code. Each handler should only print out all the information it has, which will only be things like the command and arguments provided. Essentially each command should echo its input.

Let's make a plan.
```

## 2

```
Let's not use the name "type" in the CLI, instead call it "category". Update everywhere.
```

## 3

```
Let's remove the build command altogether
```

## 4

````
These are the current subcommands:

```
  list <resource> <category>  List resources of a specific category
  peek <resource> <id...>     Peek at one or more resources by ID
  show <resource> <id...>     Show one or more resources by ID
```

This project will support many resources over time. We will create a system that allows adding a module with the appropriate exports which can be used to support each of the three subcommands.

The signature for the functions in these modules should mirror the subcommand. For example:

- `listResource(resource, category)`
- `peekResource(resouce, ...ids)`
- etc

Make a plan.
````

## 5

```
Remove `peek` subcommand from the project

## 6 [plan mode]

Currently we support "abstract" <resource> subcommands:

list <resource> <category> List resources of a specific category
show <resource> <id...> Show one or more resources by ID

Let's support "concrete" subcommands instead, e.g:

list example <category> List examples of a specific category

When we run the cli, each possible resource type (found in @src/resources/modules/) should also return everything needed to make a new "list" and a new "show" subcommand.

Potentially a good implementation would be for each module in @src/resources/modules/ to import commmanderjs (look up /tj/commanderjs with context7) and export everything needed to "plug" into the CLI.
```

## 6.1

```
That looks good but we need the output to be:

show example <id...> Show one or more example resources by ID

Rather than how it is now:

show <example> <id...> Show one or more example resources by ID
```

## 6.2

```
Now it looks like this:

Commands:
list List resources
show Show resources
help [command] display help for command

But it should look like this

Commands:
list examples List examples
show examples Show examples
help [command] display help for command
```

## 7 [plan mode]

```
We previously made a tool in python that would take a local clone of a github repo and process it down into a folder full of files that are useful for another project I'm working on. Read the source code here: ~/code/docs/ui-composer-mcp.xml

Use the ui-composer-mcp.xml code as a reference to undestand the logic that parses and processes the documentation from a specific github repo into the desired format.

Introduce a new module in @src/resources/modules/ called `shadn`.

It will be an expensive function so it will gather all the resources to a filesystem cache ~/.meta-composer/cache/resources/shadcn (similar to how ~/code/docs/ui-composer-mcp.xml works)

When calling the `list` function it will warm the cache if it doesn't exist yet.

When calling the `show` function it will return an error if the cache doesn't exist yet.

Both subcommands should continue to do nothing other than this new behavior, we will finish the business logic using the cached data at a later time.

Work through the process of warming the cache when `list` is called accoring to the correct logic at ~/code/docs/ui-composer-mcp.xml
```

## 7.1 [plan mode]

```
Ignore everything about lucid icons
```

## 8

```
Implement `meta-composer shadcn list` command

The list command alrady does the work to warm a file cache

Now we will read from that cache to return a meaningful response when calling the `meta-composer shadcn list` command

We originally implemented all of this in a python project that you can read here: ~/code/docs/ui-composer-mcp.xml. You can read the source, specifically the file ./ui_composer_mcp/server.py and the function ui_show_component_details, to learn how to work with the cached data and return the expected response. Implement it to work identically and return the equivelent string when the `meta-composer shadcn list` command is called.
```

## 9

```
Remove the example command
```

## 10 [plan mode]

```
Implement `meta-composer shadcn show` command

The show command currently does nothing. The list command shows a list of shadcn components with names and metadata. The list command draws it from a file cache that it creates as needed.

Now we will read from that cache to return a meaningful response when calling the `meta-composer shadcn show` command

We originally implemented all of this in a python project that you can read here: ~/code/docs/ui-composer-mcp.xml. You can read the source, specifically the file ./ui_composer_mcp/server.py and the function ui_show_component_details, to learn how to work with the cached data and return the expected response. Implement it to work identically to ~/code/docs/ui-composer-mcp.xml. and return the equivelent string when the `meta-composer shadcn show` command is called.
```

## 11

```
Help fix some issues, mostly related to the show command we recently implemented.

The help command look like this:

list shadcn List shadcns
show shadcn Show shadcns

But they should look like this:

list shadcn core List shadcn core
show shadcn core <name> Show shadcn core

Notice that the category and name are required positional arguments.
Right now you provide a name without the category and it works but it should not work. Items are always shown are in the context of a category.

Also the show command should throw an error if the cache is empty, it shouldn't try to warm it.
```

## 12

```
This works OK but it throw an error because of extra arguments

meta-composer list shadcn core x y z
```

## 12.1

```
It **should** return an error when there are extra arguments beyond what is expected.
```

## 13

```
Everywhere that we refer to a "name" regarding shadcn items we should call it "id".

That means that when we build the cache we should bake "id" instead of "name" if applicable.

Look for documentation, comments, and code and ensure everything is properly renamed.
```

## 14

```
When I run:

▶ ./dist/cli.js --help

I see the correct --help output but it is followed by this.

Error: (outputHelp)
```

## 15

```
Fix:

▶ ./dist/cli.js list shadcn core
Error listing shadcn: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'localeCompare')

## 15.1 [interrupt]

```
I think we need to regenerate the cache.

I deleted it.

Try again, and continue.
```

## 16

```
There is a bunch of output in the list command for shadcn that is a holdover from a previous project and now we want to get rid of it.

Please remove the "Instructions" hardcoded text preamble along with the heading "Components"
```

## 16.1

```
Is there anything that's being prepended/appended to the list output or show output that we might want to trim?

Let's not return any trailing/leading whitespace in either command if we currently are.
```

## 17 [human]

```
Added autocil config
```

## 18

````
In the shadcn core list output rather than a textual id, use an incrementing decimal starting with 1.

Now we have:

```
- id: accordion
  title: Accordion
  description: >-
    A vertically stacked set of interactive headings that each reveal a section
    of content.
- id: alert
  title: Alert
```

The new output should be:

```
- id: 1
  title: Accordion
  description: >-
    A vertically stacked set of interactive headings that each reveal a section
    of content.
- id: 2
  title: Alert
  [...snip...]
```
````

## 18.1

```
The show command has to be updated to use the number rather than the nam
```

## 18.2

````
It appears to only return a small amount of the content now. The output ends abruptly:

```
▶ ./dist/cli.js show shadcn core 3
# Alert Dialog
A modal dialog that interrupts the user with important content and expects a response.
## Demo
<ComponentPreview
```
````

Run the command directly to see the output while you work on fixing it.

## 19

```
Add a new module `meta-composer list openapi <uri>` and `meta-composer show openapi <uri>`

Unlike the `shadcn` module there is no caching involved.

Unlike the `shadcn` command which has a single hardcoded "category" this one has takes a dynamic <uri>.

For `list` treat the URI as a fetchable JSON endpoint that will return an openapi json spec. Show a list of the verbs, names, and descriptions, assigning each a numeric ID. Follow the list format of `shadcn core` as much as it makes sense.

For `show` return all the details about the endpoint requested in a compact markdown format
```

## 19.2

```
I'm not seeing it when I run --help. Should I?
```

## 19.3

````
It's not looking good:

```
Commands:
  list shadcn core
         list openapi <uri>            List resources
  show shadcn core <id>
         show openapi <uri> <id>  Show resources
  help                                                  display help for command
```
````

## 19.4

````
That's actually a lot better. Good idea.

Problem I see is that only shadcn shows for both list --help and show --help:

```
▶ meta-composer show --help
Usage: meta-composer show [options] [command]

Options:
  -h, --help              display help for command

Commands:
  shadcn <category> <id>  Show shadcn core
  help [command]          display help for command
```
````

## 19.5

```
Add a list of installed modules on the main help screen? i.e. shadcn, and openapi
```

## 19.6

```
Let's move them to live just below the description
```

## 20 [plan mode]

```
We previously made a tool in python that would take a local clone of a github repo and process it down into a folder full of files that are useful for another project I'm working on. Read the source code here: ~/code/docs/ui-composer-mcp.xml

Use the ui-composer-mcp.xml code as a reference to undestand the logic that parses and processes the documentation from a specific github repo into the desired format.

Introduce a new module in @src/resources/modules/ called `icons`.

It will be an expensive function so it will gather all the resources to a filesystem cache ~/.meta-composer/cache/resources/icons/lucid (similar to how ~/code/docs/ui-composer-mcp.xml works).

When calling the `list` function it will warm the cache if it doesn't exist yet.

When calling the `show` function it will return an error if the cache doesn't exist yet.

Work through the process of warming the cache when `list` is called accoring to the correct logic at ~/code/docs/ui-composer-mcp.xml

Also, when we made the shadcn resource we placed the cache in this directory:

~/.meta-composer/cache/resources/shadcn

For consistency we should place it in ~/.meta-composer/cache/resources/shadcn/core Don't worry about backwards compatibility. I'll delete the old cache now and we can create a new one after the feature is complete.

Ignore all of the shadcn related code in ~/code/docs/ui-composer-mcp.xml and only concentrate on the lucid related code.
```

## 21

```
`list icons lucid` Returns a huge amount of information because of the denormalized nature of the records.

▶ ./dist/cli.js list icons lucid| head -n 30

- name: a-arrow-down
  tags:
  - letter
  - font size
  - text
  - formatting
  - smaller
    categories:
  - text
  - design
- name: a-arrow-up
  tags:
  - letter
  - font size
  - text
  - formatting
  - larger
  - bigger
    categories:
  - text
  - design
- name: a-large-small
  tags:
  - letter
  - font size
  - text
  - formatting
    categories:
  - text
  - design

Instead we want to require an additional required positional argument called <type> that can be icons, tags, or categories

Then the output for each will be only a single list of unix items of that type

For example `meta-composer list icons lucid icons`:

- a-arrow-down
- a-arrow-up
  [...snip...]

For example `meta-composer list icons lucid tags`:

- letter
- font size
  [...snip...]

For example `meta-composer list icons lucid categories`:

- text
- design
  [...snip...]
```

## 21.1 [plan mode]

```
Great for anything schema or validation related, where it makes sense, use zod (use context7)
```

## 21.2 [plan mode]

```
Always use `pnpm add` to add new dependencies
```

## 22.3 [plan mode]

```
Before we go ahead an execute the plan I'm wondering if you see other places we should be using zod. Asking for the purpose only to revisit it later, so please let me know but don't add it to the current plan we're about to execute.
```

## 23 [plan mode]

```
Please give me a list of all the possible commands available

When you call ./dist/cli.js --help it gives a list of possible commands. Walk the tree of commands and make a report for me. Even though the commands start with a verb please organize them by the following "resource" name (e.g. openapi, shadcn)
```

## 23.1 [plan mode]

```
I would like help changing the order of arguments

Please look for all related code, comments, and docs as you update the app

The current way looks like this:

- list shadcn core
- show shadcn core <id>
- list openapi <uri>
- show openapi <uri> <id>
- list icons lucid <type>
  - icons
  - tags
  - categories
- show icons lucid <id>

The new format will be:

- shadcn list
- shadcn show <id>
- openapi list <uri>
- openapi show <uri> <id>
- lucid list <type>
  - icons
  - tags
  - categories
- lucid show <id>
```

## 23.2

```
In the openapi resource I want to change "id" everywhere to "operation-id"

That means that the openapi list command should use the operation id from openapi rather than creating ids

That also means that the openapi show command should change from having an <id> to an <operation-id> that can be used to correlate the listed paths when calling openapi list.

Update any comments, code, or documentation related to this.
```

## 23.3

```
In the shadcn resource I want to change "id" everywhere to "name"

That means that the shadcn list command should use the name of the component (which should be found in the cached data we read from) rather than creating ids

That also means that the shadcn show command should change from having an <id> to an <name> that can be used to correlate the listed components found in `shadcn list` with the corresponding detail document.

Update any comments, code, or documentation related to this.
```

## 23.4

```
In the lucid resource I want to change "id" everywhere to "name"

That means that the lucid list command should use the name of the icon (which should be found in the cached data we read from) rather than creating ids

That also means that the lucid show command should change from having an <id> to an <name> that can be used to correlate the listed icon found in `lucid list` with the corresponding detail document when calling `lucid show` (when we implement that, which we aren't doing right now)

Update any comments, code, or documentation related to this.
```

## 23.5 [plan mode]

```
Show a summary of all the commands as they exist now
```

## 23.6 [plan mode]

```
Each command will be renamed to follow a RPC-ish style of verb-noun

Currently the signatures are:

- shadcn list
- shadcn show <name>

- openapi list <uri>
- openapi show <uri> <operation-id>
- lucid list <type>
- lucid show <name>

They need to be changed to:

- shadcn list-components
- shadcn get-component <name>

- openapi list-operations <uri>
- openapi get-operation <uri> <operation-id>

- lucid list-icons <type>
- lucid get-icon <name>
```

## 23.7

```
Looks good and ready to implement. Please don't run any real commands to test it. I will test everything manually before we continue. Go! <3
```

## 23.8

```
Review all the changes we've made since commit 1d7f830d59c80e7cafd40b4fc210469563a45183

Is there any obvious cleanup we should do?

Is there any extraneous, non-essential comments added?

Does the structure make sense since we changed the way the commands are phrased and composed.

Go through all the code and the diff since the aforementioned commit and do any cleanup or maintenence that would be useful.
```

## 24 [plan mode]

```
We are going to change the signature of the lucid commands and add to the business logic.

Curently the signature for lucid commands is:

list-icons <type>
get-icon <name>

Change it to

list-icon-names
list-icon-categories
list-icon-tags

get-icons-by-category
get-icons-by-tag

For the list commands we are moving from having a <type> to having a command for each type. "icons" become "names" in the new approach.

For the get commands we are either getting list of icons based on the tags or categories they are associated with in the metadata.
```

## 25

````
When the root level command is called with `--help`, e.g. `meta-composer --help`, show all of the subcommands for each resource type:

Currently the top level command looks like this:

```
▶ ./dist/cli.js --help
Usage: meta-composer [options] [command]

A tool for composing and traversing arbitrary information

Installed modules:
  shadcn
  openapi
  lucid

Options:
  -V, --version   output the version number
  -h, --help      display help for command

Commands:
  shadcn          shadcn UI components
  openapi         OpenAPI specification tools
  lucid           Lucide icons
  help [command]  display help for command
```

And the three sub commands look like this:

```
▶ ./dist/cli.js shadcn --help
Usage: meta-composer shadcn [options] [command]

shadcn UI components

Options:
  -h, --help            display help for command

Commands:
  list-components       List all shadcn UI components
  get-component <name>  Get details for a specific shadcn component by name
  help [command]        display help for command
```

```
▶ ./dist/cli.js lucid --help
Usage: meta-composer lucid [options] [command]

Lucide icons

Options:
  -h, --help                        display help for command

Commands:
  list-icon-names                   List all Lucide icon names
  list-icon-categories              List all Lucide icon categories
  list-icon-tags                    List all Lucide icon tags
  get-icons-by-category <category>  Get all icons that belong to a specific category
  get-icons-by-tag <tag>            Get all icons that have a specific tag
  help [command]                    display help for command
```

```
▶ ./dist/cli.js openapi --help
Usage: meta-composer openapi [options] [command]

OpenAPI specification tools

Options:
  -h, --help                          display help for command

Commands:
  list-operations <uri>               List all API operations from the specified OpenAPI URI
  get-operation <uri> <operation-id>  Get details for a specific API operation by operation ID
  help [command]                      display help for command
```

For the rool level command I want to show all of the subcommands, e.g:

```
▶ ./dist/cli.js --help
Usage: meta-composer [options] [command]

A tool for composing and traversing arbitrary information

Installed modules:
  shadcn
  openapi
  lucid

Options:
  -V, --version   output the version number
  -h, --help      display help for command

Commands:
  shadcn          shadcn UI components
  openapi         OpenAPI specification tools
  lucid           Lucide icons
  help [command]  display help for command

Subcommands for lucid:
  list-icon-names                   List all Lucide icon names
  list-icon-categories              List all Lucide icon categories
  list-icon-tags                    List all Lucide icon tags
  get-icons-by-category <category>  Get all icons that belong to a specific category
  get-icons-by-tag <tag>            Get all icons that have a specific tag

Subcommands for openapi:
  [...snip...]
```

What's the best way to accomplish this? Ideally we don't have two (or more) copies of the subcommands and descriptions stores across the repo (i.e. can there comfortably be a single source of truth).
````

## 25.1

```
The formatting is still not good
```

## 25.2

```
We can remove installed modules from the output now
```

## 25.3

```
Can we clean up based on the current changes we made? Feel free to remove any non-critical comment too.

`git diff HEAD`
```

## 25.4 [interrupted]

```
Wait don't touch prompts.md. Don't update, change or delete it.
```

## 26

```
Rename

`openapi get-operation <uri> <operation-id>`
`shadcn get-component <name>`

To

`openapi get-operation-by-id <uri> <operation-id>`
`shadcn get-component-by-name <name>`
```

## 27

```
Rename list-icon-names to list-icons everywhere through the codebase. Be sure to include code, comments, and file names.
```

## 27.1

```
I still see a few instances:

src/resources/modules/icons.ts: \* List Lucide icon names, categories, or tags
src/resources/modules/icons.ts: .description('List all Lucide icon names')
src/resources/modules/icons.ts: console.error(`Error listing ${this.name} icon names:`, error)
src/resources/modules/icons.ts: description: 'List all Lucide icon names',

Don't update @prompts.md
```

## 28

````
The help text for subcommands should show the subcommand.

For example this is how it looks now:

```
Subcommands for shadcn:

  list-components               List all shadcn UI components
  get-component-by-name <name>  Get details for a specific shadcn component by name
```

And this is how it should look:

```
Subcommands for shadcn:

  shadcn list-components               List all shadcn UI components
  shadcn get-component-by-name <name>  Get details for a specific shadcn component by name
```
````
